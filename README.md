### What this is
My code to implement backpropagation for Neural Networks with a single hidden layer. This was done for the 2nd programming assignment of CS5011.
Optimises over several Step sizes and regularisation coefficients by means of a grid search.

### To Use
Keep the files 'DS2_train.csv' and 'DS2_test.csv' in the same folder and run the .py script.
